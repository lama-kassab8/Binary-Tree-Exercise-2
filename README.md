# Binary Search Tree

This repository contains my implementation of several key Binary Search Tree (BST) methods, including validation, height calculation, and balance checking.

## What I Implemented

1. **`find_min_max`** – Checks if a given binary tree is a valid BST using the min-max rule.
2. **`overall_height`** – Calculates the height of the tree recursively.
3. **`is_balanced`** – Checks whether the binary tree is balanced, meaning the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is no more than 1.

## What I Learned

- How to validate a BST using recursion and boundary values (`min_val` and `max_val`).
- How recursion works under the hood with tree structures.
- How height is computed in trees and how it's used to check if a tree is balanced.
- The difference between a balanced tree and a perfect binary tree.

## Personal Notes

- Even if my comments aren't conventional, they are clear to me and serve as a reference for my future self.
- I struggled at first, but I'm proud of how I broke it down and understood each concept deeply.
